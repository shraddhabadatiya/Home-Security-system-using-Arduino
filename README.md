# Home-Security-system-using-Arduino
# Project Overview
This project involves creating a home security system using an Arduino. The system will detect motion, monitor temperature and humidity, and can be disarmed using an RFID reader. The system will also use a "feels like" temperature calculation to determine if it should trigger alarms.

# Components
Arduino Microcontroller
DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
PIR Motion Sensor
MFRC522 RFID Reader
Buzzer
LEDs (Red and Green)
Servo Motor (optional)
Breadboard and jumper wires
Power supply
